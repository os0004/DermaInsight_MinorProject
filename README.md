Project: DermaInsight - Skin Disease Detection Web Application (MERN Stack)
Brief Introduction:
Developed DermaInsight, a full-stack web application for detecting skin diseases through image analysis. The platform integrates a ResNet-50 pre-trained model for accurate classification of skin conditions based on user-uploaded images. It offers user authentication, profile management, and interactive features, ensuring a smooth and comprehensive user experience.

Key Features:
Machine Learning Integration: Used the ResNet-50 model for high-accuracy skin disease detection.
User Authentication: Secure login and registration allowing users to create accounts and access personalized features.
Blog Creation: Users can create and share blogs, contributing to a community focused on skin health.
Detection History: Users can view their past detection results, enabling them to track progress.
Profile Management: Allows users to manage personal profiles and view their detection history and blog posts.
Report Generation: Generates downloadable PDF reports of detected diseases for offline use or sharing with healthcare professionals.
Real-Time Predictions: Instant diagnosis based on uploaded images, supported by a backend API built with Node.js and Express.
Database Management: MongoDB stores user data, detection history, and blog posts.
Responsive Design: Ensures the application is mobile-friendly and accessible across various devices.
Skills and Technologies:
Frontend: React.js, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB
Machine Learning: TensorFlow.js, ResNet-50 model
Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure login and registration
Additional Features: Blog creation, history tracking, PDF report generation
APIs: REST API development for real-time data processing
PDF Generation: Used libraries (e.g., jsPDF) to create downloadable reports
Deployment: Experience with deploying MERN stack applications on cloud platforms (if applicable)
Version Control: Git, GitHub
